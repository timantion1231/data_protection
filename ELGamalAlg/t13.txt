 TASK 1 El-Gamal algorithm (crypto)
Users A and B set connection one to another by means of  El-Gamal algoritm with  the following parameters: 
pA=  127  gA=   7   xA=   63   kA=   25 
pB=   97  gB=  10   xB=   48   kB=   19    
1) Open key A=?  Open key B=? 
2) What data A should send to B to set the connection?
3) What data B should send to A to set the connection?
User A wish send open text MA=   31 to B.
4) What cryptptext A should send to B?
5) B sent to A cryptotext {a,b}={  67, 103}. Decrypt the cryptotext.
